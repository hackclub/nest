[@benharri](https://github.com/benharri) leading the project.

This needs to serve 3 types of teenagers:

1. I know how to write HTML and CSS and just wrote my first ever backend and need to host it. Completely unfamiliar with SSH, Linux, and traditional deployments through flows like Heroku. Probably has heard of Vercel for frontend hosting. Likely coding on repl.it.

2. I have deployed backend services to places like Railway, but am deeply frustrated with their limits. I like giving a Procfile or Dockerfile and need a place to host it with a Postgres database that is reliable and won't go down. I don't need it to be "production grade", this is more for personal projects or semi-professional projects that don't have high volume. I need some kind of secrets management for environment variables.

3. I am a homelab guru, highly technical, "do you know that I run Arch / NixOS?", strongly opinioned on distros, watches DistroTube, etc. I don't use vim, I use neovim. I don't use neovim, I use a custom editor that I wrote for myself in Rust! I usually deploy my own services on my homelab, but it constantly goes down so I want something more reliable for my Slack and Discord bots / etc.
